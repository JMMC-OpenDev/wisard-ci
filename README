WISARD-CI: the simplified interface to WISARD.

WISARD (http://www.mariotti.fr/doc/approved/JMMC-MAN-2500-0001.pdf and
references inside) is a monochromatic image reconstruction program
developed for JMMC by S. Meimon and L. Mugnier, available under the
CeCILL-B license (see LICENSE and See Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.txt).

WISARD-CI is composed of WISARD plus a serie of enhancements and
additionnal procedures by G. DUVERT, making WISARD conformant to the
Optical Imaging interface requirements
(https://github.com/emmt/OI-Imaging-JRA/raw/master/doc/interface/OI-Interface.pdf),
to the OI-FITS format, and to the OImaging GUI available at
http://www.mariotti.fr/oimaging.htm

WISARD-CI installation: 
------------------------------

- get the SVN repository files
- put bin/wisard-ci in the PATH:
  > PATH=$PATH:/where/is/wisard-ci; export PATH 
 or make a soft link from a $PATH directory to it: 
  > ln -s /where/is/wisard-ci ~/bin
  (provided ~/bin exist and is in the PATH of course)

- if you have IDL, you are rich. And you do not have to follow the
  instructions below. Go to "USAGE".

- Now the hard part:

  - install GDL, the free IDL clone, available as 'gnudatalanguage' in
  your ditribution (MacOS: "brew tap Homebrew/homebrew-science" and
  "brew install gnudatalanguage" for example; look for
  "gnudatalanguage" in debian, ubuntu etc.)

  --> eventually, get the source distribution on SF:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage and follow
  compilation instructions. Prefer recent versions. Old versions of
  GDL (before 0.9.6) will be SLOW.

USAGE:
-------

if installation is ok, type "wisard-ci" and read help.

At that moment, you can either use wisard-ci in command line, or tell
the GUI that you have a local version of wisard-ci.

You can also call GDL (or IDL) and at the prompt, use the procedure wisardgui.pro.
use 
GDL> cd,"where/is/wisard-ci"; doc_library,"wisardgui" 
to print the minimum information on wisardgui procedure.

If you have IDL installed: It is the same as for GDL, but you must
edit bin/wisard-ci to replace "gdl" by "idl" and possibly add the
necessary IDL environment variables (not tested).

To USE a LOCAL INSTALL of WISARD-CI in the OImaging Gui:
--------------------------------------------------------

This is possible, provided you update the !PATH value in
wisard-ci/gdl_startup.pro : it is necessary to find the IDL procedures
of idlastro distribution, available at https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/

You start the local wisard-ci by selecting "WISARD" and not "WISARD (remote)" in the OImaging GUI.  


WARNING!: 

1) WISARD makes use of the astrolib (https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
set of procedures so be sure to have them in your (idl or gdl) !PATH.


2) WISARD uses precompiled OPTIMPACK libraries. See
https://cral.univ-lyon1.fr/labo/perso/eric.thiebaut/?Software/OptimPack
for details. If you have not a compatible library you'll need to build
one. And you are on your own on this.
